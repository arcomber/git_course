..

create a remote repository

bitbucket, github, on site storage

a remore repo is a bare repo.  has no working tree or staging area.

remore repo names end in .git by convention

on remote storage / server, git init --bare


or for github go onto github and create a new repository.

on github you can't do the git init --bare I don't think so you setup first there, and then clone it to local
